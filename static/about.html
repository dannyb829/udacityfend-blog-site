            <p class='about-description'>Hello! if you’re reading this i guess you’ve already gotten to see a bit of
                what i can do. I am a Brooklyn, New York born and raised developer. Since i was a child I’ve always
                loved technology, always taking things apart putting them back together. I was the computer savy kid in
                the family, always on my compaq whether it was playing games, downloading music on limewire, or checking
                to see if I had new messages on myspace. Fast forward, I’ve been blessed to have learned the inner
                workings of the internet and software. Started out building a command-line tic tac toe game, today
                building full websites.</p>
