                    <p><strong class="article-subheading">We</strong> We all have creativity in our minds. And though
                        beauty is in the eye of the beholder we have an idea of what looks good and what doesnâ€™t. When
                        it comes to web development, achieving that super clean cut and awesome design isnâ€™t as easy as
                        a few CSS rules and nice colors. The cutting-edge designs you see on popular sites today are a
                        result of years of dev experience and dedicated focus on CSS knowledge. Intricate creation and
                        the slightest detail achieved by various lines of code and implementation of an array of
                        different CSS properties.</p>
                    <p>I can say that as a beginner dev, achieving that kind of design has been near impossible
                        <u>without
                            the knowledge</u> and much less time to do thousands of googles to find the necessary rules
                        to
                        apply. Especially when you have a project due at school on Friday ðŸ˜©. This has resulted in me
                        settling for the mediocre application of colors and subpar web layouts containing overlapping
                        divs and uncentered items. I figured since I was still learning my instructors really didnâ€™t
                        care as long as the logic was right and the site functioned as expected. So I always did this,
                        or rely on a project partner to deliver on the design. Iâ€™ll get there one day.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-subheading">Reality</h3>
                    <p>Only sometimes you canâ€™t really wait for that <em>one day</em> . I am currently in my last phase
                        of
                        learning at the Flatiron school software engineering Bootcamp and am currently developing my
                        capstone project. Meaning I should be applying all my knowledge and dish out the best website I
                        have ever created during my time at this school. Not only that, this is the first real project
                        that I will be advertising myself with when I'm looking for employment. I had to do it right.

                    <h3 class="article-subheading">Ease of use</h3>
                    <p>I had used material UI a couple of times before. I was always a little intimidated by using it
                        being that there was so much code to work with and unfamiliar components. This time around I
                        took my time to look at what everything was doing and how I could apply it to my design.
                        Realizing I could really dig in and edit the code provided to me, and tailor it to whatever it
                        is I wanted to display. A few days into my project and I have already achieved a super clean
                        site layout. And I find myself plugging things in as I need them. Moving them around and
                        resizing them like a pro! Particularly useful components that I have found are the Grid (useful
                        for quickly giving a structure to your page in a grid format, using Grid items to display
                        different sources of content), the Card ( Quite awesome for mapping different objects like
                        articles or friend details and other things) and the App bar (for a clean nav bar, edit its
                        functions and links as you need).</p>
                    <h3 class="article-subheading">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>In conclusion, if you find yourself feeling disappointed that you canâ€™t whip up that perfect
                        design, just remember we learn at different paces. We also should be patient because no matter
                        how many googles it takes you or youtube videos you have to watch, you will eventually become a
                        pro. Besides, you can always take advantage of pre-written code to take your site to the next
                        level. MUI, alongside a bunch of other component APIs and CSS frameworks like semantics UI and
                        Bootstrap. Just take your time to learn how to implement them, <u>the documentation is your
                            friend</u>.
