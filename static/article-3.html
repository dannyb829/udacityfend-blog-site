                    <p><strong class="article-subheading">Visualize</strong> yourself in a maze. Blindfolded. You may
                        have been here before, and you can kinda guess that you have to get to the center. The path to
                        your goal is disorienting and treacherous. You could try to break through the walls enough times
                        to do this but that might leave you hurt and it might just be too much work. No. You know what
                        to do here. It’s left, a right, left, left right left and in a jiffy you are where you need to
                        be. Many have taken this path, those that have been there have bestowed upon you the knowledge.
                        No struggle needed.</p>
                    <p>Snapping back to reality, unfortunately, <em>we are not wizards traversing the mystical unknown,
                        warding off evils, fighting our way through a maze until we find the golden egg…</em> darn! Probably
                        just a coding dream, a metaphor for passing your rspecs, following convention over configuration
                        in the attempt to access the golden utopia of having your code work. We all do things
                        differently, we are all individuals. But many of us follow a certain pattern because they have
                        shown repeated results. We drive with one foot, so we can avoid confusing the brake and gas
                        pedals. We paint up and down to finish quickly, instead of left and right. And we take the same
                        way to work/school every day because, for the most part, it’s what gets us there the quickest.

                    <h3 class="article-subheading">Convention</h3>
                    <p>Enough analogies. As the godfather of rails imagined and ultimately created for our use, rails
                        heavily implements most of its code for certain conventions that iron out any complications and
                        long drawn out coding, making our lives easier. Following these conventions, primarily naming
                        and file structures, effectively allows us to have files layed out for that would otherwise have
                        taken time to create and type out. As soon as you type out rails new <file_name> — api you have
                            your rails back-end.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="article-right padding">
                    <p> Not only is this done for us. but defining routes in the way templated by rails is a one-liner.
                        <blockquote>resources model_name </blockquote> takes care of your crud routes, leaving you only to define its methods
                            within your controllers. Bear in mind that doing this requires you to use the method naming
                            conventions e.g for your GET actions you need to have methods #index (for retrieving all
                            entries for a table) and #show (for retrieving a specific entry). Imagine having your code
                            mostly typed out for you! imagine no more.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-subheading">Configuration</h3>
                    <p>Bear also in mind that we are developers. So we do much tweaking and tailoring to our needs.
                        There is many a case in which we would need to create custom methods that using the conventions
                        simply do not provide. But we as developers also love reusability, and that's something that (if
                        following RESTful conventions) allows for. Aside from that, deviating from the conventions
                        leaves a lot of room for guessing and testing your code, which given any time constraints is not
                        what you want. Moreover working with a team begs for a general consensus on how this code should
                        look, what better way than one that we probably have all probably learned. Your custom methods
                        are better spent on handling those special cases should they arise.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-subheading">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>With this awareness of the time you could be saving, you are better equipped for any project in
                        that you’ll be able to easily work with others, and very quickly put together things without
                        having to memorize so much. Giving you time after to focus on handling special cases. Not just
                        on rails, but in any language, library, or framework, knowing what the conventions are, gives
                        you the predictability your code needs.</p>
