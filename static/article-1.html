                    <p><strong class="article-subheading">We</strong> all know how important doing things in the right
                        order is. We wake up, brush our teeth, shower, then go to work. We do not go to work, shower
                        then brush our teeth. This would surely result in your coworkers avoiding any communication or
                        contact with you. We make sure that we are clean and smell good before we go to work. Oh no! we
                        forgot to eat breakfast, erase everything go back and INSERT ‚Äúeat breakfast‚Äù.‚Äù Whew, can‚Äôt work
                        on an empty stomach‚Ä¶ wait where are my keys???‚Äù. To avoid these troublesome situations, we keep
                        an exact order of operations (routine if you will) that we executed at their respective required
                        times. No, you are not eating breakfast at night, and no you are not taking your keys with you
                        after work because <em>how are you getting back into your house?</em></p>
                    <h3 class="article-subheading">when_you_code</h3>
                    <p>Coding in general is a very specific process. We very explicitly tell the computer what it is we
                        need it to do and it meticulously reads and executes our code.. in order.. from top to bottom..
                        from left to right. Any missing ends of inputs, parentheses, commas, etc., and your file will
                        throw an error. Bad syntax is one thing we know that will mess up our code. But what if what it
                        is we were typing didn‚Äôt particularly cause errors, but caused some unexpected behaviors? ‚ÄúHello
                        world! my name is nil ! nice to meet you !‚Äù. Hmmm, what can we guess went wrong here? A variable
                        called name could have possibly been given nil as a value and only changed after this sentence
                        was printed out. Jeez. Go back erase everything and make SURE that you give name a proper value
                        before you go off using it any old place. ‚ÄúHello world!, my name is Daniel !, nice to meet you
                        !‚Äù. Much better. Not everything gives a syntax error, and if your code was 5000 lines long then
                        finding this particular problem might have been a painstakingly long process.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-subheading">timingItRight</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes you want to hold off on taking certain actions when actually doing things. You might
                        put together that perfect sandwich, but figure you are not hungry yet and want to eat it later
                        in the day and put it in your lunch box. You‚Äôll find that you might do the same thing sometimes
                        with your functions. You put together that delicious function const tasteySandwich =
                        (ingredients) => {console.log(‚Äúeat sandwich‚Äù)}. But the mood doesn‚Äôt strike just yet. Make sure
                        you invoke tasteySandwich only when your onHungry event listener fires off like so -
                        onHungry={tasteySandwich}. Say you want to eat this same sandwich every 30 sec (wanna see you
                        try) how would you do that?? setInterval(tasteySandwich, 30000) should accomplish this if you
                        are that hungry. What if you just wanted one sandwich after 30 sec? setTimeout(tasteySandwich,
                        30000). When coding, all the tools are there for you to achieve specific timing and execution
                        flow. It makes our programs just that much more <u>robust.</u></p>

                    <h3 class="article-subheading">aRecentChallenge</h3>
                    <p>Quite recently i came to this realization that coding in certain conditions and timers is very
                        important if we are expecting our code to ALWAYS behave a certain way given any edge cases. I
                        was working on a button for a music guessing game that would select an answer from a user. The
                        problem was that there was a certain delay between when that button was clicked and the next
                        would appear, leaving perfect room for the undesirable double click. This double click was
                        causing answers to be submitted twice and it was driving me crazy. WHAT DO I DO?? After a few
                        minutes of due diligence I realized that I could access the disabled property of my button ,
                        disable it and voila!! Right? maybe not. I was still getting the issue. I decided to actually
                        use my brain to deduce what was going on step by step.

                        one, the user clicks the answer button.
                        two, the event listener handles network requests and makes changes
                        three, button is disabled
                        four, between a first click and when changes are actually made to the DOM there is a fraction of
                        a second delay due to asynchronous network requests.
                        five, in this time it is possible for the second click to trigger everything again</p>
                    <h3 class="article-subheading">realization</h3>
                    <p>Okay so I disabled the button doesn‚Äôt that mean I can‚Äôt click it again? apparently not. Since
                        ‚Äòdisabled‚Äô is only an attribute, There is no logic included into whether a click on this button
                        should do anything with a disabled property. Dang it‚Äôs so obvious now. What I needed to do was
                        incorporate this logic. How do I tell my program to only do something IF a certain condition is
                        met? When all else fails a good ol‚Äô If else statement tells your program when and how. If i now
                        tell my button that upon click IF e.target.disabled === false then proceed to execute code, then
                        set e.target.disabled = true. So now in that split second after the first click, if the user
                        clicks again, the event listener will fire off, the logic will say e.target.disabled === true
                        and will not execute any of the code. ‚ÄúWoohoo!‚Äù Problem solved and I was able to move on to my
                        many other headaches.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-subheading">conclusion in.. i mean in conclusion..</h3>
                    <p>In conclusion, not all things are as easy as brush your teeth before you go to work. Code can
                        very quickly get very complicated and it is SUPER EASY to lose track of the order in which
                        things are happening. If it helps at all, i say they best way to ensure you are executing in the
                        right order and getting the desired output even when you have been up since 6am and it is now
                        9pm and your brain has checked out for the night is to write things down in a list in order of
                        occurrence; then decide what should be happening and when. Make the proper adjustments.<em>Take
                        your time to ensure proper rhythm and execution flow!</em> 

                        Also if that doesn‚Äôt work just erase it all and start over‚Ä¶. ü§£</p>
