                    <p><strong class="article-subheading">Hear</strong> me out. Everyone speaks in a different manner or
                        tone depending on who they‚Äôre with. We are even careful with choice of words and subject when it
                        comes to this. This makes sense because you wouldn‚Äôt talk to an interviewer at your potential
                        future employment in the same way that you would talk to your friends. ‚ÄúHey dude, sick mustache
                        =D‚Äù to your future boss doesn‚Äôt sound right. Instead you would say to your future boss, ‚ÄúYes
                        Indeed, my experience has allowed me to achieve such and such‚Ä¶ i expect to acquire this and that
                        and so on and so on‚Äù. We choose to speak in a clear and concise manner when we are in
                        professional settings. Not just to appear professional, but to be understood!</p>

                    <p>In whatever language you type; because you want anyone who is reading your code to understand
                        what it is you are saying or trying to accomplish with your code; you will type as if you are
                        typing to someone you don‚Äôt know. This means declaring variable names that are clear and
                        concise. Don‚Äôt over abbreviate as if you were typing to your friends. Thats only cool on
                        iMessage‚Ä¶ <em>lol .. wtw ..wtf.. lmao ‚Ä¶ wyd ‚Ä¶STD(sure thing dude) and so on</em>. Not everyone
                        will
                        understand that. This type of talk is NSFW! and it will not be tolerated in the coding world. If
                        you need to express laughter in a javascript variable, please type const laughingOutLoud or
                        const laughinMyAssOff‚Ä¶</p>

                    <p>Try going back a few years in your messages if you can‚Ä¶ as far back to your teenage years.
                        Imagine trying to decipher what the heck you were talking about with your friends. Using slang
                        and weird acronyms you surely do not use today. This is OK because who cares, we were kids. But
                        imagine if it was your job to go in to the past, log these conversations, and to refactor them
                        into something else. Now, imagine trying to do this with someone else's messages.
                        <em>YIKES!</em></p>

                <div class="article-right padding">
                    <p>I myself am in the process of learning to code. Even at this stage often times, i found myself
                        having to go back to code that i wrote just a few days before and ended up having to read it
                        many times over. This was because old me thought i was cool and that if i saved a few lines of
                        code by over abbreviating things that i was being efficient! Not so efficient i guess when you
                        have to take a look back. What might take you a few more minutes today, will save you hours,
                        alongside quite a few headaches down the road.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-subheading">inReact</h3>
                    <p>Upon learning React, I realized that the importance of meaningful variable naming is magnified
                        because React itself is meant to be modular. This means there will be parts of your code that
                        will be reused and repeated throughout your app. Also meaning that you will be separating your
                        code into many different files. Proper variable naming is key here because in the process of
                        importing and exporting variables and functions between your files you want to make sure that
                        you can keep track of what it is you are passing around. For example when giving an alias to a
                        default export named ProgramInfoFile, pF might be clear to you for a few seconds, but when you
                        come back to it after a few hours and after naming a trillion other variables you will surely
                        say WTF is pf??? Giving it an alias of ProgramInfo or ProgramFile would work better but by then
                        its better to just not give an alias.. because in this case ‚Ä¶ like why.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-subheading">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>To be clear. As a software engineer you are well able to name your variables to your liking and
                        to your understanding. Allow this piece of info to be a reminder that unless you are a one man
                        show, <u>YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY PERSON READING YOUR CODE</u>, and if you are working with other
                        people
                        then you are definitely reading other peoples code. So be mindful and pay this forward, this
                        makes for a friendly coding ecosystem. At the very least if you are in the process of learning
                        like me, don‚Äôt piss off your instructors with meaningless code üíØüòÇ .TYPE LIKE YOU MEAN IT!</p>
